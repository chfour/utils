# utils

this is a repo containing some small utilities I've written,
to do various different things

no documentation is provided, these programs might have help commands
and if one doesn't it should be self-explanatory

I also don't guarantee everything here works

oh and most of this stuff is probably going to be really hacky

## descriptions of some of the utilities

* `imgview.py` - simple image viewer in python using unicode half-block characters (also probably my favorite out of all these),
can be used as a module
* `maketable.py` - makes tables with random data, output can be pasted into google sheets
* `spaceify` - makes `s p a c e d  o u t  t e x t` from stdin
* `mc-nonpremium-prox.py` - a proxy for minecraft which theoretically should allow you to
connect to a nonpremium server with an arbitrary username from a premium client. not sure if it works.
* `simple-https-server.py` - like `http.server`, but for https
* `autoclick.sh` - automatically clicks a location every N seconds
* `discord-webhooks/webhooksender.py` - utility to send messages using discord webhooks, can be used as a module
